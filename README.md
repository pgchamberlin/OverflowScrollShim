OverflowScrollShim
==================

Android 2.x devices don't support CSS overflow: scroll, this shims it.

The shim is based on [touchscroll.js](https://github.com/chrismbarr/TouchScroll), but differs in that it scrolls
horizontally.

On an Android 2.x phone? [Try it out here](http://peterchamberlin.com/experiments/OverflowScrollShim/demo.html).
